Approach:
take k elements from the start and then keeping on adding one element from the end and delete the corresponding element from the current array and maintain a maxx variable to keep count 
of the max sum


COde:
int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<k;i++)
            left += cardPoints[i];
        int currmax = left;
        for(int i = n-1;i>n-1-k;i--)
        {
            left -= cardPoints[k-1-(n-1-i)];
            left += cardPoints[i];
            currmax = max(currmax, left);
        }
        return currmax;
    }
