Using InPlace algorithm

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. In other words, it modifies the input in place, without creating a separate copy of the data structure. 
Just exchanged the last anf the first character of the string and so on until it reaches the middle of the string.

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        char temp;
        int n = s.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++)
        {
            temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[n-i-1];
            s[n-i-1] = temp;
        }        
    }
};
